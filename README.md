## Business Problem

Five-Stars Luxury Cordiality is a hotel company that operates in more than 100 
countries around the world with Resorts and Urban hotels in its network.
Receiving more than 50,000 annual reservations, the hotel chain has as its 
biggest problem the high cancellation rate, which in the years 2015 to 2017 
reached approximately 37%.

The company is studying the implementation of a new service, a campaign that
will serve customers in the period following the reservation until check-in
to reduce the cancellation rate.

It was calculated that the new service will cost $100 per reservation and 
there will be a profit of $600 if the reservation is confirmed, the calculation
was made excluding reservations that would be confirmed even without the campaign.

For the effectiveness of the campaign, it is desired that the budget is directed
to the reservations that are likely to be canceled and are most likely to be 
converted.

The professionals responsible for the project imagined that it would be necessary
to classify the reservations. A high accuracy model was requested that identifies
the probability of each reservation being canceled and reports the expected profit
of the campaign for the next 10000 reservations. Therefore, the project that will 
be presented to solve the business problem must contain the following information:

1. Main insight after data analysis
2. What will be the campaign profit if it is necessary to reach all the reservations
3. What will the campaign profit be if it reaches only 10% of the reservations
most likely to have a positive return.
4. What will the campaign profit be if it reaches only 20% of the reservations
most likely to have a positive return.
5. What will the campaing profit be if it reaches all the reservations predicted
to be cancelled.
